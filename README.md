# BorderColors D

## Mail-extension version âš 

A mail-extension version compatible with TB78+ is in progress. The initial
version will lack some feature, but I plan to bring most back.

However, some styles are not possible with the new API. If you have suggestions
for new ones, open a issue on GitHub.


## This extension

If you have Thundebird configured with multiple accounts or identities, you
might have sent emails from the wrong one once or twice. This add-on tries to
prevent that mistake by adding a colorful border around the "New message"
window.

You can configure each identity to have a different color, and choose among a
number of border styles: partial borders, gradients, etc.

This add-on builds on [BorderColors][bc] and [BorderColors-GT][bc-gt].

  [bc-gt]: https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/addon/bordercolors-gt/


## How to install

Head over to [addons.thunderbird.net][bc-d] to find the current version.
Development releases might be available earlier in the [Releases] section.

Remember to uninstall other BorderColors add-ons if you are using this version!
